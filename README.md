# diceware_generator
a program to facilitate the generation of random diceware passwords.
as of now it is only a simple number generator. it gernerates a 5 digit number that representes 5 dice rolls to obtain a random 5 digit number, and match that number with the corrisponding word in the diceware wordlist.txt

I wish to eventually automate the entire process and have it output the words themselves and take out the need to look up the words manually.
